	<h1>p2p berlin #1</h1>

	<p><strong>when: 19:00, 11 June 2019</strong></p>
	<p><strong>where: co.up community space</a> 3rd floor, Adalbertstraße 8, 10999 Berlin</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Bring your laptop if you want to connect on Scuttlebutt!</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Hosted by: Eileen Wagner, Chris Adams & Vincent Ahrend</strong></p>

	<p>This is the first installment of p2p berlin, a regular get-together for everyone drawn to distributed and decentralised technology and a new Internet outside of corporate control.</p>

    <p>If you are on the web today, you depend on cloud infrastructure driven and controlled by people you don't know. Peer-to-peer can be a wonderful technology to break out of this stronghold by creating your own infrastructure. In the past two years there has been a resurgence of this tech in projects like the Dat-Protocol, IPFS and Secure Scuttlebutt, building everything from low-level libraries to full-on decentralised replacements of social media platforms.</p>

	<p>Please come join us for this informal gathering to learn about recent developments in the field, show and tell about our own p2p projects and to find out how you can make use of and contribute to these projects yourself.</p>
